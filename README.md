# vagrant-scotch-box-3.5-PHP-7.2

Vagrant Scotch Box  3.5  based environment **PLUS PHP 7.2, Xdebug, php code sniffer and composer ready to use**, just clone it and Vagrant up :P The original box comes with PHP 7.0.x no Xdebug and no composer or PHPCS so I made this repo to make it easier for everyone to use it as upgraded box with all PHP 7.2 modules.

Please visit Scotch Box main repo and support them , they are Awesome :)
